## Introduction

The To-Do List App provides the user with an easy way to keep track of their tasks. The app provides the user with all the necessary options that are needed to manage their tasks. Including creating a task, viewing their tasks, removing a task and more. The user can do everything from the terminal. The app is deployed on Heroku using Code Institute's mock terminal template. If a user tries to remove or mark task as done that doesnâ€™t exist they will be shown the menu again and they could reselect the option or choose a different one. The user is provided with the option of marking a task as undone if they have made a mistake or change their mind.

## Project 

The objective for this project is to:

- Allow the user to conveniently manage their tasks.
- Allow the user to add as many tasks as they would like.
- Allow the user to keep track of the status of their tasks.
- Allow the user to remove any task they would like.
- Allow the user to change the status of their tasks from Not Done to Done and vice verse as many times as they would like.
- Allow the user to see the timestamps for their task was created.
- Allow the user to exit the app.
