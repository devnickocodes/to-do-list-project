## Introduction

The To-Do List App provides the user with an easy way to keep track of their tasks. The app provides the user with all the necessary options that are needed to manage their tasks. Including creating a task, viewing their tasks, removing a task and more. The user can do everything from the terminal. The app is deployed on Heroku using Code Institute's mock terminal template. If a user tries to remove or mark task as done that doesnâ€™t exist they will be shown the menu again and they could reselect the option or choose a different one. The user is provided with the option of marking a task as undone if they have made a mistake or change their mind.
