# Validation

I imported [this](https://pypi.org/project/pep8/) python style checker.

I used the [CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/) to validate the code. After removing some blank lines, whitespaces and adjusting lines that were too long the code passed the validation with no issues.
